# Assignment: Self-Directed Website Creation

## Objective:

- Demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS by creating a self-directed website with multiple pages on a topic of your choice.
- Practice structuring content logically using `<div>` elements with `id` attributes in HTML.
- Apply creative CSS styling to enhance the visual presentation of the website.
- Showcase your skills to a global audience as the website will be hosted online.

## Instructions:

### Topic Selection:

Choose a topic that interests you and aligns with your passions or hobbies. This could be anything from travel, photography, gaming, sports, cooking, technology, fashion, or any other area of personal interest. If you're unsure, consider creating a page about a holiday destination you have visited and enjoyed, or would like to visit in the future. Pages for such a site could include general info, local attractions, cost breakdown, local cuisine, travel tips, etc.

### Pre-Coding Preparation:

Before you begin coding, follow these steps:
1. Draw a template of what you would like your page to look like.
2. Consider how to translate your template into a webpage using your HTML/CSS skills.

### HTML Structure:

Start by creating a new HTML file for your website. Define `<div>` elements with meaningful `id` attributes to organize the content logically. Consider structuring your pages with sections such as:
- Header with website title/logo and navigation menu.
- Main content sections related to different aspects of your chosen topic.
- Additional sections like about, contact, portfolio/gallery, blog, or any other relevant content.
- Footer with contact information or social media links.

### CSS Styling:

Utilize a linked CSS file to apply styling to your HTML elements consistently across all pages. Experiment with creative and visually appealing styles, including but not limited to:
- Adjusting font sizes, colors, and styles for headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- Adding background images, gradients, or colors to enhance the overall look.
- Applying hover effects, transitions, or animations to interactive elements like links and buttons.
- Using flexbox or grid layout to achieve responsive design and ensure compatibility across different devices.

### Page Creation:

Create a minimum of four separate pages for your website, each focusing on different aspects or subtopics related to your chosen theme. Ensure that each page has:
- Unique and relevant content specific to its topic.
- At least one high-quality image or multimedia element related to the content.
- Proper navigation links to allow users to navigate between pages easily.

### General Expectations:

Your website should meet the following minimum requirements:
- Minimum of four separate HTML pages with unique content.
- Linked CSS file that controls styling across all pages.
- At least two external links directing users to relevant resources or websites.
- Minimum of one high-quality image or multimedia element per page.
- Logical organization of content using `<div>` elements with appropriate `id` attributes.
- Consistent and visually appealing styling applied to all elements using CSS.
- Proper use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements to structure and present content effectively.

### Submission:

Save your completed HTML and CSS files along with any additional multimedia resources in a dedicated folder named after your project. Host your website online, and provide the URL for access.
Submit the URL along with any additional files to your instructor via the designated platform.

### Tips:

- Choose a topic that genuinely interests you to stay motivated throughout the project.
- Plan your website structure and content layout before starting the HTML and CSS coding.
- Use online tutorials, resources, and inspiration from existing websites to enhance your design and styling skills.
- Test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.
