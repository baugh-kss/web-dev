#Assignment: Defining Divs and CSS Styling

##Objective:

Practice defining <div> elements with id attributes in HTML.
Apply CSS styling to the defined <div> elements and their child elements.
Instructions:

##HTML Setup:

You will be provided with a basic HTML document without any <div> elements defined and with an empty <style> section in the <head>.
Your task is to define <div> elements in the HTML document by adding appropriate id attributes as instructed in the assignment.
You should create <div> elements to structure the content logically, considering elements such as header, main content, sidebar, and footer.
CSS Styling:

Utilize the provided empty <style> section in the <head> to write CSS rules for styling the defined <div> elements and their child elements.
Apply CSS styling to at least 15 items in the HTML document, including but not limited to:
<div> elements and their child elements (e.g., #main h2)
Headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)
Paragraphs (<p>)
Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>)
Links (<a>)
Any other elements you find appropriate.

#Notes:
- There are 3 HTML provided, please pick the one that appropriately fits your current skill level.
- The challenge.html, if highly polished, would most easily translate to an 'extending' mark.
- A fully completed assign1.html would likely translate to a 'proficient' mark.  
- The assign1.html is a good starting place for most.  Take your time and approach it multiple times if neccessary.  
- You could start with the guided.html to get a good understanding and then complete and sumbit the challenge.html 
  with a little more ease, and still be able to earn an 'extending' mark.

##Submission:

Once you have defined <div> elements in the HTML document and applied CSS styling, save both the HTML and CSS files.
Submit your completed files to your instructor, via e-mail or Github or Google Drive.

Note: This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling. Take your time to organize the content effectively using <div> elements and apply CSS styling creatively to enhance the visual presentation of the webpage. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of this assignment. Good luck!
